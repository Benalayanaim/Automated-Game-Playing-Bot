Create a bot using Selenium and Python to click on the cookie as fast as possible.

 After 5 minutes have passed since starting the game, stop the bot and print the "cookies/second". e.g. this is mine:

<img width="1150" alt="2020-08-19_14-52-01-d5ffd27f6980af9fbf9a8bc37e85eb6c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91dfc051-3ee6-4a50-a5ae-a400dfb0bad8">

5. Once you've managed to get the bot to work, feel free to tweak the algorithm if you think there is a better way to play the game. e.g. Change the time, instead of every 5 seconds to check the upgrades, what if you did every second. Or maybe the bot should buy all the affordable upgrades. Post your algorithm in the Q&A and impress us all if you manage to get a higher cookies/second with your algo.
