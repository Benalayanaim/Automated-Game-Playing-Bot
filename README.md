# Cookie Clicker Bot

This project is a simple bot that automates playing the "Cookie Clicker" game. The bot is implemented using Selenium, a web automation tool, and it continuously clicks the cookie to collect points and purchase upgrades to increase the cookie production rate.


Create a bot using Selenium and Python to click on the cookie as fast as possible.

 After 5 minutes have passed since starting the game, stop the bot and print the "cookies/second". e.g. this is mine:

Once you've managed to get the bot to work, feel free to tweak the algorithm if you think there is a better way to play the game. e.g. Change the time, instead of every 5 seconds to check the upgrades, what if you did every second. Or maybe the bot should buy all the affordable upgrades. Post your algorithm in the Q&A and impress us all if you manage to get a higher cookies/second with your algo.
